## Simple software for combining layers from different G-code files into one G-code file that can be 3D printed.
**NOTE:** *G-code Combiner is only compatible with G-code files generated with **Ultimaker Cura** (support for other slicers will be available in the near future).*

### What's the main idea behind this?
This software was created to make retraction test towers using files from Ultimaker Cura.
Latest version of the slicer have option to change some settings on layer basis, but the retraction settings aren't on the list.
That's the main idea behind this piece of software.

### What can I use it for?
Well, retraction towers are actually one of the many things that you can do in G-code Combiner.
Let's say you want to test how your 3D printer is behaving using different speeds. You would need to print same object
many times and compare all the prints side by side to determine how the speed affects the final print. G-code Combiner
allows you to do all of that with just one print. In order to do that you need to slice the same object with different settings and after that import them to G-code Combiner. Then you just choose which layers will be taken from which file and export the file. 

:boom: **You have "speed" tower :D**

### But I can do that with just a text editor...
Yes, you can. But doing this with G-code Combiner will consume less time and will be much easier!
